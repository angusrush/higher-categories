\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:introduction}

These notes grew out of a course given by Prof.\ Tobias Dyckerhoff at the University of Hamburg. However, much of the presentation and many of the proofs are heavily adapted. All mistakes are entirely my own.

\section{Axiomatic framwork}
\label{sec:axiomatic_framwork}

These notes are phrased in terms of $\mathbf{ZFCU}$, i.e.\ the Zermelo-Frenkel axioms together with the following axioms.
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\mathbf{C}$: the axiom of choice.

  \item $\mathbf{U}$: Grothendieck's universe axiom.
\end{itemize}

\section{Notation}
\label{sec:notation}

\begin{itemize}
  \item This course used the wrong\footnote{I.e.\ opposite to the nLab, wikipedia, Categories Work, etc.} convention for units and counits: we will denote units by $\epsilon$ and counits by $\eta$.

  \item We will denote hom-sets $\mathcal{C}(a, b)$.
\end{itemize}
